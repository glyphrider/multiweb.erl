# MultiWeb

Using rebar, you can grab the dependencies and build the application. It will start up with **webcore** running. This is the base web application that sets up Webmachine (listener port, etc.). You can dynamically turn on and off the webpart application which dynamically adds and subtracts routes from Webmachine.
